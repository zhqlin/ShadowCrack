1.How the code is structured?

      -This program is commented in the right side of the code.
       The program is divided into seperate .py files. So you
       can run MD5 Hash cracker directly without running
       ShadowCrack. This makes hacking easier, as you don't need
       to open ShadowCrack, then choose if encrypt or crack, blah
       blah... Shadow Team uploaded ShadowCrack to let novice or
       Professional Ethical Hackers, Security Enthusiasts, or
       hobbyists to use or view the source code of this software.
       Note that SHADOW TEAM IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY NEGATIVE
       EFFECTS THIS SOFTWARE MAY CAUSE. NEGATIVE EFFECTS MAY BE
       LOSS OF DATA, FINANCIAL LOSS, CONFIDENTIAL DATA LEAK, OR
       EVEN IMPRISONMENT. USE THIS SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

2.Comment Tags

      -Comment tags are used to easily understand
       the logic of a program. The comment tags
       labels the code if it has errors, needs to
       be frequently updated, where you left off,
       and more.
